## Intro 



## Getting Start Firmata
Firmata library has shipped with all the Arduino IDE (better > 1.6 version) so can be found in the IDE in arduino root 
directory, for example : 

    arduino-1.6.6/libraries/Firmata
    
Here you can find all the stuf about the library and how to use it ! In Arduino TRE of course, all the stuff has already shipped with the Arduino Environment on the Debian environment, so you can find all the stuff in the : 

    /usr/src/arduino/hardware            // hardware stuff and binary 
    /usr/src/arduino/libraries           // libraries 
    /usr/src/arduino/libraries/Firmata   // Firmata library with code and examples 
    
If you have the Firmata library installed with the right version you should to loading the sketch **AllinputsFirmata.ino** 
that you can find in the Web-Ide, now the Atmel processor has loaded all the right stuff we can stop to deal with it and we can start to think at the program to install on the host (Linux) to use the Firmata bridge between the core !

On the Host Server we can install the Firmata implementation we prefer :
