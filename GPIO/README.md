GPIO
==== 


## Intro 
We can try some test on the GPIO pin of the Arduino tre board,we start with a bief test Arduino Libraries for Linux Userspace  [github][1]. 

## Userspace Arduino 
Currently there are 2 methods to compile and execute Arduino code on a board with linux onboard : 

+ Native compilation
+ Cross compilation

### Native compilation 
first of all you don't need to install any toolchain, connect the board through ssh
