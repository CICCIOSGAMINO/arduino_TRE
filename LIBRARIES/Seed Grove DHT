Grove Temperature & Umidity Sensor- DHT 
==========================================

### Intro 

Go pro in temperature and relative humidity measuremnt applications with this Grove gadget. This is a powerful
sister version of our Grove - Temperature and Humidity Sensor. It has more complete and accurate performance than
the basic version. The detecting range of this sensor is 5% RH - 99% RH, and -40°C - 80°C. And its accuracy
satisfyingly reaches up to 2% RH and 0.5°C. A professional choice for applications that have relatively strict
requirements.

### Arduino TRE path : 

Here some path for find the right things in just a second on the Arduino TRE board  : 

+ sketch ( /home/tre/Arduino ) 
+ user's libraries ( /home/tre/Arduino/libraries )
+ example ( /usr/src/arduino/examples )
+ hardware (/usr/src/arduino/hardware )
+ libraries (/usr/src/arduino/libraries ) 

Is a better choice hold the user's and arduino's libraries in differet folder. 

### Import the library on board

To import the library on the Arduino TRE board, you can use the IDE (not working so good in beta testing) or load the 
libary in the user library path (/home/tre/Arduino/libraries ).
